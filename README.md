Created a basketball manager simulation game, which will simulate a basketball season and have a draft, regular season, playoffs, and as well trades and free agency. This game and simulation is inspired by NBA2k MyNBA mode and other similar games such as Football Manager, and is a passion project. The game will as well include distinct players and teams and will simulate each game and have the stats and outcomes generated, and will depend on many different factors such as individual ratings, injuries, home/away, and other such features.  The game will include AI, Machine Learning features, and a GUI to interact with the game and view the game. 


The game is still in progress, and only the base of it is implemented so far.
